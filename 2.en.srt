1
00:00:05,910 --> 00:00:07,610
My dad used to tell me

2
00:00:08,109 --> 00:00:10,050
I had to be tough since I'm a man

3
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:14,220
and therefore,
the leader of the family.

4
00:00:14,289 --> 00:00:16,219
Zen, come and have breakfast.

5
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:22,789
But Mom would tell Dad off
if she heard him.

6
00:00:23,329 --> 00:00:26,429
Then she'd tell me it's okay
to feel weak even if you're a man

7
00:00:26,829 --> 00:00:28,329
if you need to do so.

8
00:00:31,969 --> 00:00:34,469
You're holding
your father's present again.

9
00:00:34,969 --> 00:00:36,170
Aren't you hungry?

10
00:00:39,439 --> 00:00:43,520
Grandma, do you think Mom and Dad
are going to miss us?

11
00:00:43,750 --> 00:00:45,149
Of course.

12
00:00:45,250 --> 00:00:47,250
Just like how we miss them.

13
00:00:54,689 --> 00:00:56,689
Don't worry, Grandma.

14
00:00:56,829 --> 00:00:58,829
Even though
they're not here anymore,

15
00:00:58,929 --> 00:01:00,729
I'll look after you.

16
00:01:01,829 --> 00:01:03,469
Okay then.

17
00:01:25,260 --> 00:01:26,319
Dad,

18
00:01:26,859 --> 00:01:27,890
Mom,

19
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:29,930
please be my strength from afar.

20
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:36,129
(The Rebound)

21
00:02:36,389 --> 00:02:39,099
(Directed by Tanwarin Sukkhapisit)

22
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:41,400
Ryu.

23
00:02:42,770 --> 00:02:45,000
Is this really the life
you've chosen?

24
00:02:45,169 --> 00:02:46,539
It's easy for you to say.

25
00:02:46,939 --> 00:02:48,409
How can you possibly know?

26
00:02:54,909 --> 00:02:55,979
As for basketball,

27
00:02:57,849 --> 00:03:00,120
are you going to
let someone tell you

28
00:03:00,949 --> 00:03:02,650
to win

29
00:03:03,319 --> 00:03:04,560
or lose a game?

30
00:03:05,789 --> 00:03:07,159
Shut your mouth.

31
00:03:09,930 --> 00:03:11,530
Seriously,

32
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:14,629
who are you

33
00:03:15,699 --> 00:03:17,139
playing basketball for these days?

34
00:03:25,409 --> 00:03:26,610
And you?

35
00:03:27,349 --> 00:03:30,479
Who do you play for
every time you play?

36
00:03:31,919 --> 00:03:33,050
The people I love.

37
00:03:36,819 --> 00:03:38,689
Everyone who taught me
to love basketball.

38
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:42,990
That makes two of us.

39
00:03:43,159 --> 00:03:45,300
So why are you doing it?

40
00:03:45,759 --> 00:03:47,400
Why don't you follow the rules?

41
00:03:47,629 --> 00:03:48,830
Shut up.

42
00:03:51,039 --> 00:03:52,069
Wait.

43
00:03:53,610 --> 00:03:54,610
What now?

44
00:03:55,409 --> 00:03:56,870
Where do you live now?

45
00:03:57,409 --> 00:03:58,810
I'll wash your shirt
and return it to you.

46
00:03:58,979 --> 00:04:00,449
No need. You can have it.

47
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:02,050
But don't ever throw it away.

48
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:05,449
I'll kill you if I find out you did.

49
00:04:23,839 --> 00:04:27,740
Hey, you call that running?
That's pathetic!

50
00:04:28,170 --> 00:04:29,839
Do you think you're
at Lumphini Park?

51
00:04:29,939 --> 00:04:32,639
Are you planning to do aerobics
or tai chi afterward?

52
00:04:32,879 --> 00:04:34,610
Put your back into it!

53
00:04:35,379 --> 00:04:36,649
Ugh!

54
00:04:37,850 --> 00:04:39,949
My mother can run
faster than all of you.

55
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:12,819
I'm so exhausted!

56
00:05:14,350 --> 00:05:16,319
You're such a whiner.

57
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:18,160
- It was only a run.
- Move away.

58
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:20,220
It was only a run?

59
00:05:20,290 --> 00:05:21,459
- You're weak.
- Shut up.

60
00:05:21,529 --> 00:05:22,490
- What?
- Shut up.

61
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:24,430
- Take this.
- Hey, stop!

62
00:05:24,899 --> 00:05:25,899
Hey!

63
00:05:28,199 --> 00:05:29,370
Are you going to work, Zen?

64
00:05:32,370 --> 00:05:34,209
About the coach, are you really
going to let this happen?

65
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:38,310
We'll have to wait and see.

66
00:05:38,810 --> 00:05:40,810
But I won't let it go
if he's just fooling around.

67
00:05:42,610 --> 00:05:43,680
Right, First.

68
00:05:44,079 --> 00:05:45,480
Can you help me prepare the court
for practice tomorrow

69
00:05:45,579 --> 00:05:47,250
if you get here early?

70
00:05:47,319 --> 00:05:49,120
Sure. I'll see you then.

71
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:08,540
Here. I'll help you.

72
00:06:09,009 --> 00:06:11,180
You don't have to.
You already showered.

73
00:06:11,439 --> 00:06:13,079
I can take another shower, can't I?

74
00:06:13,279 --> 00:06:15,449
Come on. Hand over the cloth.

75
00:06:16,110 --> 00:06:17,149
Mm.

76
00:06:23,889 --> 00:06:26,160
Have the guys on the team
said anything?

77
00:06:28,129 --> 00:06:30,500
Should I be honest or polite?

78
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:31,899
Whoa.

79
00:06:32,230 --> 00:06:34,329
If that's what you're saying,

80
00:06:35,129 --> 00:06:36,629
then just be honest.

81
00:06:39,139 --> 00:06:42,370
Well, I don't know.
It's only the beginning.

82
00:06:46,310 --> 00:06:47,649
It's only the beginning, I guess.

83
00:06:48,779 --> 00:06:49,779
First,

84
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:52,350
do you mind helping me
with something?

85
00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:53,750
What is it?

86
00:06:56,089 --> 00:06:57,689
Can you tell me

87
00:06:58,589 --> 00:06:59,959
if you hear anything?

88
00:07:01,329 --> 00:07:03,759
Please? Can you?

89
00:07:04,699 --> 00:07:06,560
We don't have much time left,

90
00:07:07,029 --> 00:07:08,730
and there's a game coming up.

91
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:10,569
Please help me

92
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:12,339
in case...

93
00:07:13,540 --> 00:07:15,970
I might be able to help
our team get qualified.

94
00:07:16,769 --> 00:07:19,279
Please? Can you help me?

95
00:07:20,779 --> 00:07:23,310
Please? I'm begging you.

96
00:07:23,779 --> 00:07:26,350
Oh, okay.

97
00:07:26,649 --> 00:07:27,649
For real?

98
00:07:27,949 --> 00:07:28,949
Mm.

99
00:07:33,319 --> 00:07:37,060
Don't tell me I have
to do that with you?

100
00:07:37,230 --> 00:07:38,360
Mm.

101
00:07:38,730 --> 00:07:41,300
I'd rather not. It tickles.

102
00:07:41,399 --> 00:07:43,399
- Come on. Promise me.
- No.

103
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:44,540
- No.
- First.

104
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:46,139
- Oh?
- And the thumb.

105
00:07:46,769 --> 00:07:47,769
There.

106
00:07:48,209 --> 00:07:51,680
If you break the promise,
you'll be dead the day after next.

107
00:07:52,209 --> 00:07:53,209
Remember that.

108
00:07:53,439 --> 00:07:54,449
Mm.

109
00:08:18,399 --> 00:08:19,870
Pick up your pace!

110
00:08:21,410 --> 00:08:22,740
Just like that!

111
00:08:23,410 --> 00:08:24,610
Hurry up!

112
00:08:53,639 --> 00:08:54,740
Yes!

113
00:08:54,870 --> 00:08:56,240
That's it!

114
00:09:21,799 --> 00:09:24,200
Hello? Your coffee's arrived.

115
00:09:24,870 --> 00:09:27,269
I'm waiting near the front.

116
00:09:33,980 --> 00:09:35,980
Don't let him get past you!

117
00:09:36,850 --> 00:09:37,850
Thank you.

118
00:09:50,129 --> 00:09:52,500
Hey, what's with the foul play?

119
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:54,970
Foul play? Isn't that normal?

120
00:09:55,129 --> 00:09:57,399
There are no rules here.

121
00:09:57,639 --> 00:09:58,840
And don't forget

122
00:09:58,970 --> 00:10:01,210
you were playing dirty last time.

123
00:10:01,940 --> 00:10:03,269
- You punk.
- Hey.

124
00:10:03,940 --> 00:10:07,409
If your friend can't play, doesn't
that mean we win by default?

125
00:10:07,509 --> 00:10:08,850
And the money's ours.

126
00:10:09,450 --> 00:10:10,649
Stop right there.

127
00:10:14,049 --> 00:10:15,220
Go and sit reserve.

128
00:10:23,929 --> 00:10:24,929
Can you get up?

129
00:10:25,159 --> 00:10:26,159
I don't think so.

130
00:10:26,529 --> 00:10:29,000
So? Are you going to forfeit?

131
00:10:36,870 --> 00:10:38,710
Hey, you.

132
00:10:39,409 --> 00:10:40,409
What?

133
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:51,090
Can you substitute for my friend?

134
00:10:51,190 --> 00:10:53,259
What? Me?

135
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:55,360
Yes, you'll get 2,000 baht
if we win.

136
00:10:55,460 --> 00:10:56,659
You're in need of money, aren't you?

137
00:10:59,529 --> 00:11:00,970
Come on.

138
00:11:07,870 --> 00:11:09,039
What kind of pass is that?

139
00:11:09,139 --> 00:11:10,070
Why didn't you catch it?

140
00:11:10,139 --> 00:11:11,710
That was a bad pass.

141
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:21,590
It's okay. Get up.

142
00:11:21,950 --> 00:11:23,049
What's wrong with you?

143
00:11:23,690 --> 00:11:25,190
He didn't bump into you that hard.

144
00:11:25,990 --> 00:11:28,389
Not that hard?
Do you want to give it a try?

145
00:11:28,529 --> 00:11:29,590
Hey!

146
00:11:30,129 --> 00:11:31,700
You can continue
the discussion at home, kids.

147
00:11:33,830 --> 00:11:34,830
Come on.

148
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:42,370
Let's do it this way.
I'll watch your back.

149
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:43,440
What?

150
00:11:43,539 --> 00:11:44,639
What are you confused about?

151
00:11:44,710 --> 00:11:47,080
I said I'll watch your back
if they're going to hurt you.

152
00:11:47,210 --> 00:11:48,379
Just keep scoring points.

153
00:12:41,169 --> 00:12:42,230
Come on!

154
00:12:53,809 --> 00:12:54,809
Zen.

155
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:14,830
Yes!

156
00:13:15,399 --> 00:13:16,399
Go! Go!

157
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:28,610
Ryu, well done!

158
00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:30,409
Well done!

159
00:14:06,279 --> 00:14:07,279
Here.

160
00:14:13,659 --> 00:14:15,460
You did very well today.

161
00:14:16,190 --> 00:14:17,259
Thank you, Boss.

162
00:14:27,740 --> 00:14:28,809
Oh?

163
00:14:29,340 --> 00:14:30,980
Why'd you stop like that?

164
00:14:31,309 --> 00:14:33,009
You're as clumsy as always.

165
00:14:33,879 --> 00:14:35,480
And you're annoying as always.

166
00:14:40,850 --> 00:14:42,850
Here's your cut.

167
00:14:49,990 --> 00:14:52,960
Is this the reason
why you're playing here?

168
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:54,600
Mm.

169
00:14:58,340 --> 00:15:00,000
And where do you live now?

170
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:01,610
Have you gone home at all?

171
00:15:02,070 --> 00:15:03,870
Just take the money and go.

172
00:15:09,850 --> 00:15:11,019
I'll only take this much.

173
00:15:11,549 --> 00:15:12,549
How come?

174
00:15:13,649 --> 00:15:15,919
You already paid for the coffee.

175
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:18,289
Don't you have to pay back your debt
to those guys as well?

176
00:15:19,590 --> 00:15:21,460
I overheard them
shouting at you about it.

177
00:15:23,559 --> 00:15:25,700
I already sorted that out.
Can you give it a rest?

178
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:27,559
Just take all of it.

179
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:29,529
Ryu.

180
00:15:30,129 --> 00:15:31,139
Come on.

181
00:15:31,570 --> 00:15:33,600
- Take it.
- You keep it.

182
00:15:34,669 --> 00:15:36,409
You'll be able to take
your grandmom to a doctor too.

183
00:15:42,779 --> 00:15:44,179
She asked about you

184
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:46,279
when you disappeared at first.

185
00:15:47,649 --> 00:15:50,990
But honestly, she's still
asking about you.

186
00:15:53,259 --> 00:15:54,259
Really?

187
00:15:56,259 --> 00:15:57,259
Mm.

188
00:15:59,629 --> 00:16:00,700
Ryu.

189
00:16:04,870 --> 00:16:06,200
Your skill...

190
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:08,769
is still the same as when we were
in middle school.

191
00:16:09,970 --> 00:16:12,039
Haven't I improved at all?

192
00:16:14,779 --> 00:16:15,909
Now that you've mentioned it,

193
00:16:16,879 --> 00:16:18,279
you've gotten better.

194
00:16:22,519 --> 00:16:24,320
Actually, I think you've become
much more skilled.

195
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:25,960
Mm.

196
00:16:30,559 --> 00:16:32,299
The game just now

197
00:16:34,529 --> 00:16:36,500
reminded me
of our middle school team.

198
00:16:39,039 --> 00:16:40,340
Now that I think about it,

199
00:16:42,039 --> 00:16:43,809
I miss when we played
basketball together.

200
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:52,450
Right, Zen.

201
00:16:52,950 --> 00:16:55,320
There's somewhere I need to be.
I have to go now.

202
00:16:55,649 --> 00:16:57,990
Don't come around here again
if you can.

203
00:16:59,190 --> 00:17:02,129
Hey, have you been
to school at all?

204
00:17:04,630 --> 00:17:07,799
The school's not
the place for me. You know that.

205
00:17:16,809 --> 00:17:18,839
(Tonliu Computer Repair)

206
00:17:53,710 --> 00:17:56,980
I just want to remind you we have
to submit the names next Friday.

207
00:17:57,410 --> 00:17:58,420
I know.

208
00:18:00,319 --> 00:18:02,220
And who's going to play
which position?

209
00:18:03,950 --> 00:18:05,160
I don't know.
I'm still working on it.

210
00:18:05,319 --> 00:18:07,859
What? We might run out of time.

211
00:18:10,890 --> 00:18:12,000
What's the problem?

212
00:18:13,529 --> 00:18:14,599
PF.

213
00:18:15,630 --> 00:18:17,130
- The power forward?
- Mm.

214
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:20,740
The one in control of the game
who also scores.

215
00:18:21,170 --> 00:18:23,369
I don't know who to pick
from our lineup.

216
00:18:54,940 --> 00:18:55,940
Dad!

217
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:58,109
- Dad!
- What?

218
00:18:58,440 --> 00:18:59,440
Look at this.

219
00:19:00,279 --> 00:19:01,279
What?

220
00:19:01,450 --> 00:19:04,480
Here's the power forward
you've been looking for.

221
00:19:13,289 --> 00:19:14,289
What do you think?

222
00:19:26,339 --> 00:19:27,339
Right.

223
00:19:27,769 --> 00:19:29,140
I was...

224
00:19:29,869 --> 00:19:31,170
on the edge of my seat today.

225
00:19:31,779 --> 00:19:33,509
I bet a lot

226
00:19:34,009 --> 00:19:35,309
of other people's money on you.

227
00:19:36,180 --> 00:19:38,420
Good thing your friend
came to the rescue,

228
00:19:39,079 --> 00:19:41,490
or I'd need to pack up
and run away to Poipet.

229
00:19:44,450 --> 00:19:45,960
Didn't you have any faith in me?

230
00:19:46,119 --> 00:19:47,119
Of course I did.

231
00:19:47,460 --> 00:19:48,890
I'm a basketball player.

232
00:19:49,690 --> 00:19:51,059
I can tell

233
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,599
who's real and who's fake.

234
00:19:57,099 --> 00:19:58,140
Your friend

235
00:19:58,970 --> 00:20:00,039
is quite good.

236
00:20:00,839 --> 00:20:02,369
Should we get him to work with us?

237
00:20:05,980 --> 00:20:07,039
Leave him alone.

238
00:20:07,410 --> 00:20:09,049
He's not suitable for the business.

239
00:20:12,450 --> 00:20:13,549
All right.

240
00:20:14,079 --> 00:20:17,220
You moron, you scared me
for a second there.

241
00:20:20,359 --> 00:20:21,859
Drink up. I bought it for you.

242
00:20:50,150 --> 00:20:52,890
Whoa, these look so yummy, Grandma.

243
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:54,390
Don't they?

244
00:20:54,589 --> 00:20:58,759
We can put them into these baskets
according to the orders.

245
00:21:02,569 --> 00:21:03,769
Hm.

246
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:09,140
Why is Khao Tom Mat
always in a pair?

247
00:21:09,210 --> 00:21:11,210
You're a curious one, aren't you?

248
00:21:13,109 --> 00:21:14,809
I don't know either.

249
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:18,079
But back in the olden days,
they said

250
00:21:18,220 --> 00:21:20,019
it was the dessert of lovers.

251
00:21:20,319 --> 00:21:23,420
Young couples would bring it
to the temple as a merit offering

252
00:21:23,690 --> 00:21:26,660
so their love life would prosper.

253
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:28,730
Oh.

254
00:21:29,559 --> 00:21:32,299
I thought a single one wouldn't
be filling enough,

255
00:21:32,359 --> 00:21:34,200
and that's why there are two.

256
00:21:34,299 --> 00:21:36,299
What brought you to that conclusion?

257
00:21:37,230 --> 00:21:39,440
You really are
a scholarship student.

258
00:21:39,970 --> 00:21:44,410
It's a sports scholarship,
not an academic one.

259
00:21:44,740 --> 00:21:46,440
I don't do that well in school.

260
00:21:46,509 --> 00:21:49,779
Says who?
My grandson is one smart cookie.

261
00:21:49,849 --> 00:21:51,750
You're a genius.

262
00:21:52,250 --> 00:21:54,619
And you're the best at bragging
about your grandson.

263
00:22:00,690 --> 00:22:02,259
- Grandma.
- Hm?

264
00:22:03,359 --> 00:22:05,029
Do you remember Ryu?

265
00:22:06,029 --> 00:22:07,299
Of course.

266
00:22:08,430 --> 00:22:10,230
Why? Have you found him?

267
00:22:11,940 --> 00:22:12,940
Yes.

268
00:22:14,039 --> 00:22:18,039
I found him near
where I'm working part-time.

269
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:20,710
Oh, that's great.

270
00:22:21,509 --> 00:22:24,049
How strange.
He turned up all of a sudden

271
00:22:24,210 --> 00:22:25,950
and disappeared all of a sudden.

272
00:22:26,950 --> 00:22:28,690
Invite him over sometime.

273
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:31,920
Sure.

274
00:22:32,859 --> 00:22:34,119
- Mm.
- I'll bring him over.

275
00:22:34,759 --> 00:22:37,960
By the way, are you going
to work at the pool?

276
00:22:38,430 --> 00:22:41,359
Of course, I'm super stingy.

277
00:22:41,829 --> 00:22:43,430
I'll never miss a day of work.

278
00:22:49,009 --> 00:22:50,640
Bring on the riches.

279
00:23:23,410 --> 00:23:24,440
Cheers.

280
00:23:28,910 --> 00:23:29,980
It's so strong.

281
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:34,680
Boss?

282
00:23:36,819 --> 00:23:39,460
Enjoy yourself.
I'll come back later.

283
00:23:39,559 --> 00:23:40,559
There's no need.

284
00:23:42,259 --> 00:23:44,900
We know each other
through and through,

285
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:47,730
and you're embarrassed over this?

286
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:50,200
Sit.

287
00:23:55,569 --> 00:23:58,009
- Go and look after him.
- Yes, Boss.

288
00:23:58,380 --> 00:24:00,710
I'll pass.

289
00:24:00,809 --> 00:24:02,109
Let's get to the point.

290
00:24:02,380 --> 00:24:03,509
I don't think so.

291
00:24:04,450 --> 00:24:05,450
Go on.

292
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:15,089
I think your friend, Ryu,

293
00:24:15,930 --> 00:24:18,960
has grown up quite a lot this year.

294
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:22,970
Do you remember? You told me

295
00:24:23,369 --> 00:24:25,000
you were going to bring him to me.

296
00:24:25,799 --> 00:24:26,940
When?

297
00:24:29,869 --> 00:24:32,980
He's preparing for a game.

298
00:24:34,279 --> 00:24:35,880
I don't think now's the right time.

299
00:24:36,079 --> 00:24:38,250
Who gets to say
when the time's right or wrong?

300
00:24:43,420 --> 00:24:44,690
All of you, get out.

301
00:24:51,930 --> 00:24:52,930
Boss,

302
00:24:53,900 --> 00:24:54,900
I'm just

303
00:24:55,369 --> 00:24:57,599
doing my best
to take care of your interest.

304
00:24:58,269 --> 00:25:02,440
You should know how much money
Ryu's been making for us.

305
00:25:03,170 --> 00:25:04,809
A racehorse like him

306
00:25:05,380 --> 00:25:06,980
doesn't have a very long shelf life.

307
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:08,849
What if he gets injured?

308
00:25:23,329 --> 00:25:24,730
Like you?

309
00:25:30,369 --> 00:25:31,529
You know

310
00:25:31,940 --> 00:25:33,569
I'll never

311
00:25:33,839 --> 00:25:35,839
abandon my people,

312
00:25:37,140 --> 00:25:38,410
even if they can't play.

313
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:41,480
Go and get him.

314
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:54,460
You keep

315
00:25:55,390 --> 00:25:56,730
talking about him.

316
00:25:58,500 --> 00:25:59,930
Your words are

317
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:02,569
hurting my feelings.

318
00:26:17,279 --> 00:26:18,480
Are you...

319
00:26:19,519 --> 00:26:20,849
going to give it to me tonight?

320
00:26:30,690 --> 00:26:31,960
If that's what you want.

321
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:39,940
Can I even refuse?

322
00:27:00,559 --> 00:27:01,559
Hey!

323
00:27:02,759 --> 00:27:04,289
Hey! Hey!

324
00:27:25,319 --> 00:27:26,420
Are you okay?

325
00:27:31,690 --> 00:27:33,119
Are you really okay?

326
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:34,759
Mm.

327
00:27:37,029 --> 00:27:38,190
Did you get a cramp?

328
00:27:39,730 --> 00:27:42,569
No, I was diving.

329
00:27:42,700 --> 00:27:43,700
What?

330
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:45,700
Diving?

331
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:48,910
Then why were you still like a log?

332
00:27:49,410 --> 00:27:50,869
You really scared me.

333
00:27:53,339 --> 00:27:56,180
But anyway, thanks a lot.

334
00:27:58,250 --> 00:27:59,819
I'm Atom.

335
00:28:00,119 --> 00:28:01,119
You?

336
00:28:01,750 --> 00:28:02,789
Zen.

337
00:28:03,250 --> 00:28:04,250
Hm.

338
00:28:05,089 --> 00:28:06,920
Do you like swimming?

339
00:28:07,289 --> 00:28:08,829
Do you come here often?

340
00:28:09,230 --> 00:28:10,230
No,

341
00:28:10,460 --> 00:28:11,960
I'm working here part-time.

342
00:28:12,630 --> 00:28:13,529
See?

343
00:28:14,430 --> 00:28:15,930
- Oh.
- That's right.

344
00:28:16,299 --> 00:28:17,599
Saturdays and Sundays.

345
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:22,539
Anyway, I should get back
to cleaning the pool.

346
00:28:22,710 --> 00:28:23,740
Should I give you a hand?

347
00:28:24,369 --> 00:28:25,440
No!

348
00:28:25,839 --> 00:28:27,309
You're a customer here.

349
00:28:28,609 --> 00:28:31,750
I might lose my job
if the owner sees you working.

350
00:28:33,279 --> 00:28:34,279
I have to go.

351
00:29:02,009 --> 00:29:04,210
Hello? What's up, First?

352
00:29:08,250 --> 00:29:09,220
Huh?

353
00:29:09,890 --> 00:29:10,990
Say what?

354
00:29:48,059 --> 00:29:52,000
(Dad: Where are you?
Why aren't you home?)

355
00:29:56,430 --> 00:29:59,099
(I went out swimming.)

356
00:30:00,170 --> 00:30:04,069
(Dad: Good. Don't overexert yourself
or you might pull a muscle.)

357
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:16,349
First, I thought you said
you got beaten up.

358
00:30:17,390 --> 00:30:19,390
- And what's...
- Thanks for coming.

359
00:30:30,799 --> 00:30:32,140
Should we play a one-on-one game?

360
00:30:33,799 --> 00:30:35,000
With you, old man?

361
00:30:35,710 --> 00:30:38,509
Zen, can you compete
against this poser?

362
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:42,109
Why do I have to?

363
00:30:43,009 --> 00:30:44,349
Just do it.

364
00:30:44,549 --> 00:30:46,880
I'll coach you.
Just follow my orders.

365
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:48,720
It'll be an easy win.

366
00:30:51,190 --> 00:30:52,920
I won't do it. It's a waste of time.

367
00:30:54,059 --> 00:30:55,089
Scared, huh?

368
00:30:56,190 --> 00:30:58,230
- Me? Scared?
- Mm.

369
00:31:04,730 --> 00:31:06,569
You came all the way here
to challenge my guy.

370
00:31:07,869 --> 00:31:09,170
Aren't you going
to cough up a little?

371
00:31:10,910 --> 00:31:12,039
How does 5,000 baht sound?

372
00:31:13,140 --> 00:31:14,609
So we won't be wasting
our precious time.

373
00:31:21,119 --> 00:31:22,119
Sure.

374
00:31:23,819 --> 00:31:24,819
Deal.

375
00:31:28,089 --> 00:31:29,529
He didn't even ask me.

376
00:31:34,799 --> 00:31:36,670
Since we're betting on this game,

377
00:31:36,970 --> 00:31:39,140
should we switch from a spin ball
to something a little risky?

378
00:31:41,769 --> 00:31:43,569
If not, then what?

379
00:31:43,940 --> 00:31:45,069
A jump ball.

380
00:31:50,150 --> 00:31:51,079
All right.

381
00:32:02,690 --> 00:32:03,690
Ready?

382
00:32:05,660 --> 00:32:06,630
Go!

383
00:32:21,079 --> 00:32:22,279
One to zero.

384
00:32:22,579 --> 00:32:24,410
Let's keep going, my dear Ryu!

385
00:32:24,779 --> 00:32:27,079
Dad, is Zen going to be okay?

386
00:32:30,049 --> 00:32:31,049
Zen.

387
00:32:33,420 --> 00:32:34,819
Don't get so close to him.

388
00:32:35,190 --> 00:32:36,289
He's good at reaching for the ball.

389
00:32:36,359 --> 00:32:38,289
He's probably good
in the semi-circle too.

390
00:32:38,559 --> 00:32:41,529
Do you want to try forcing him
to shoot from further away?

391
00:32:41,599 --> 00:32:42,930
You might have a better chance.

392
00:32:44,700 --> 00:32:45,740
Yes, Coach.

393
00:32:57,049 --> 00:32:58,819
Out of bounds. Switch.

394
00:33:06,019 --> 00:33:07,359
You might have
to switch up your game.

395
00:33:07,519 --> 00:33:08,559
Big mouth.

396
00:33:09,690 --> 00:33:10,759
Take the shot then.

397
00:33:11,259 --> 00:33:12,160
Do it.

398
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:17,970
Switch.

399
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:34,720
- Yes!
- Dad,

400
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:36,190
he did it!

401
00:33:36,690 --> 00:33:39,220
Ryu, why did you let him score?

402
00:33:39,359 --> 00:33:40,519
Let him score?

403
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:43,359
My dad's guy is
much better than yours.

404
00:33:43,660 --> 00:33:44,759
That sucker?

405
00:33:44,859 --> 00:33:45,829
That's right.

406
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:49,000
The first to score in this round

407
00:33:49,569 --> 00:33:50,769
wins.

408
00:33:52,299 --> 00:33:53,539
Hang in there, Ryu.

409
00:33:53,869 --> 00:33:55,170
Keep going, Zen!

410
00:33:58,170 --> 00:33:59,440
You're good.

411
00:33:59,839 --> 00:34:01,109
What should we do now, Coach?

412
00:34:01,839 --> 00:34:03,250
I don't think...

413
00:34:04,210 --> 00:34:06,279
he's going to let you shoot
from a distance this time.

414
00:34:06,549 --> 00:34:07,980
Name your strategy, sir.

415
00:34:11,019 --> 00:34:11,989
Okay.

416
00:34:13,789 --> 00:34:14,860
If you win,

417
00:34:15,889 --> 00:34:17,230
I'll give you 2,000.

418
00:34:20,130 --> 00:34:21,630
How about 2,500?

419
00:34:22,570 --> 00:34:23,630
Gas money.

420
00:34:24,829 --> 00:34:26,170
Okay, okay.

421
00:34:27,570 --> 00:34:31,639
But he probably wants
to keep close to you this time.

422
00:34:31,940 --> 00:34:33,980
He's going to expect you to take
the shot from afar. Therefore,

423
00:34:34,309 --> 00:34:36,210
if you want
to make yourself unpredictable,

424
00:34:36,980 --> 00:34:38,780
you have to play unpredictably.

425
00:34:41,179 --> 00:34:42,150
Yes, Coach.

426
00:34:42,420 --> 00:34:43,420
Go.

427
00:34:45,590 --> 00:34:46,489
Hang in there, Zen.

428
00:34:53,260 --> 00:34:54,230
They're inside the semi-circle.

429
00:35:04,639 --> 00:35:05,840
Piece of cake.

430
00:35:15,949 --> 00:35:17,119
Well done, Zen.

431
00:35:17,190 --> 00:35:18,650
- That was excellent!
- Ugh!

432
00:35:19,019 --> 00:35:19,960
Darn it!

433
00:35:24,929 --> 00:35:26,030
What did you tell him?

434
00:35:28,030 --> 00:35:29,070
If you want to find out,

435
00:35:30,099 --> 00:35:32,269
join the school's team.
Then I'll tell you.

436
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:35,510
See you tomorrow.

437
00:35:48,889 --> 00:35:50,949
Thank you for supporting
the school's basketball team.

438
00:35:54,690 --> 00:35:57,860
I'll see you in the gymnasium
after school tomorrow.

439
00:36:02,199 --> 00:36:03,530
There's still next time.

440
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:38,670
Let's stop waiting.
We're wasting time.

441
00:36:39,139 --> 00:36:40,599
But it's only four.

442
00:36:41,170 --> 00:36:42,809
Ryu's probably on his way.

443
00:36:42,940 --> 00:36:44,110
Have it your way.

444
00:36:45,340 --> 00:36:47,010
But don't expect much
from that kind of guy.

445
00:36:51,780 --> 00:36:52,750
Come on.

446
00:36:56,849 --> 00:36:57,889
Gather around!

447
00:37:05,630 --> 00:37:06,699
Oh? Where's Ryu?

448
00:37:07,099 --> 00:37:08,329
I don't think he's coming, Coach.

449
00:37:10,599 --> 00:37:13,570
He's probably busy, Dad.
Oops, Coach.

450
00:37:14,300 --> 00:37:16,010
Should I go and get him?

451
00:37:17,269 --> 00:37:19,579
No, it's okay if he doesn't
want to come.

452
00:37:19,639 --> 00:37:21,039
All right. The rest of you,

453
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:23,280
give me 50 laps around the court!

454
00:37:23,579 --> 00:37:24,880
- Yes, Coach!
- Yes, Coach!

455
00:37:27,119 --> 00:37:28,079
Get going.

456
00:37:55,849 --> 00:37:56,849
Ryu,

457
00:37:59,719 --> 00:38:01,179
there's a big game coming up.

458
00:38:02,219 --> 00:38:03,719
High-rollers are coming.

459
00:38:04,219 --> 00:38:05,320
Prepare yourself for it.

460
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:09,289
Hey.

461
00:38:11,530 --> 00:38:12,559
You're not saying anything

462
00:38:13,530 --> 00:38:14,699
but you know what to do, right?

463
00:38:16,599 --> 00:38:17,599
Yes.

464
00:38:23,510 --> 00:38:24,710
Here you go, Dad.

465
00:38:27,139 --> 00:38:29,250
You should try and get Ryu again.

466
00:38:29,610 --> 00:38:32,750
We'll be a lot better
if we have him with us.

467
00:38:33,349 --> 00:38:36,519
He doesn't want to come,
and I don't like forcing anyone.

468
00:38:37,119 --> 00:38:38,619
Okay, Coach.

469
00:38:38,719 --> 00:38:42,190
But let me tell you something.
We have to submit the names soon.

470
00:38:42,260 --> 00:38:45,329
And our next match
is in a few weeks.

471
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,559
You know the skill level
of the others.

472
00:39:00,340 --> 00:39:01,239
How are things?

473
00:39:03,579 --> 00:39:05,449
I heard you got enough team members.

474
00:39:06,250 --> 00:39:09,050
I did, but...

475
00:39:10,219 --> 00:39:11,989
But if we want to win,

476
00:39:12,659 --> 00:39:13,989
we have to find more.

477
00:39:14,289 --> 00:39:15,730
You have to hurry up.

478
00:39:16,190 --> 00:39:17,730
If our team can't compete,

479
00:39:18,429 --> 00:39:22,159
the school board won't
officially hire you.

480
00:39:23,329 --> 00:39:26,500
I know.
Stop with the threats, won't you?

481
00:39:27,139 --> 00:39:29,210
- The team's in your hands now.
- I know.

482
00:39:44,590 --> 00:39:45,690
That's it!

483
00:39:49,260 --> 00:39:50,730
Go! Go! Go!

484
00:39:57,730 --> 00:39:59,099
Hey, Ryu!

485
00:39:59,599 --> 00:40:00,670
Get up!

486
00:40:00,869 --> 00:40:02,070
You can't lose this one!

487
00:40:12,409 --> 00:40:13,420
Ryu!

488
00:40:13,820 --> 00:40:14,880
Where are you going?

489
00:40:15,320 --> 00:40:16,349
Time out.

490
00:40:20,860 --> 00:40:22,530
If you insist on staying
in the semi-circle,

491
00:40:23,190 --> 00:40:24,630
you'll just keep getting hurt.

492
00:40:25,829 --> 00:40:27,300
Lure them out

493
00:40:27,599 --> 00:40:29,000
and let your friends set a screen.

494
00:40:44,650 --> 00:40:45,610
Keep it up!

495
00:40:57,429 --> 00:40:58,590
Hurry up!

496
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:14,840
Mister?

497
00:41:19,349 --> 00:41:21,849
Here's your cut.

498
00:41:24,449 --> 00:41:25,519
Keep the money.

499
00:41:27,989 --> 00:41:28,989
Seriously,

500
00:41:29,659 --> 00:41:31,289
are you really going
to keep doing this?

501
00:41:32,460 --> 00:41:35,130
This place suits me best.

502
00:41:35,260 --> 00:41:36,269
Is that so?

503
00:41:37,199 --> 00:41:38,130
Then...

504
00:41:39,769 --> 00:41:41,869
why don't you look happy
when you're playing?

505
00:41:42,610 --> 00:41:43,739
I'm happy.

506
00:41:44,139 --> 00:41:45,139
Okay.

507
00:41:46,010 --> 00:41:46,980
Sure.

508
00:41:48,780 --> 00:41:50,010
But during the game just now,

509
00:41:50,710 --> 00:41:52,719
your eyes were so empty,

510
00:41:53,880 --> 00:41:55,579
not like when you were
playing against Zen.

511
00:42:02,889 --> 00:42:05,489
Think about it.
You can give me an answer later.

512
00:42:53,610 --> 00:42:54,539
Gather around!

513
00:42:55,579 --> 00:42:56,480
Come on.

514
00:42:59,210 --> 00:43:01,280
That's enough for this morning.

515
00:43:01,619 --> 00:43:04,289
Get changed and head to class. Okay?

516
00:43:04,550 --> 00:43:05,590
Hang on, sir.

517
00:43:06,090 --> 00:43:08,590
We have to submit the names
tomorrow, but we're still short.

518
00:43:37,550 --> 00:43:40,519
I'd like to introduce you
to our newest member,

519
00:43:41,019 --> 00:43:42,059
Ryu.

520
00:43:44,090 --> 00:43:46,159
Go on. Introduce yourself.

521
00:43:47,960 --> 00:43:48,960
I'm Ryu.

522
00:43:49,260 --> 00:43:50,530
I'm the power forward.

523
00:43:54,199 --> 00:43:57,239
Get yourselves ready for class.
I'll see you later this evening.

524
00:43:58,010 --> 00:44:00,480
Anyway, look after Ryu, Captain Zen.

525
00:44:27,599 --> 00:44:28,940
Why did you come back
all of a sudden?

526
00:44:29,039 --> 00:44:30,909
Didn't you say you weren't going to
play for the school team anymore?

527
00:44:31,010 --> 00:44:32,639
I wonder when the newbie's
going to stir up trouble.

528
00:44:32,710 --> 00:44:33,980
It's like having
a ticking time bomb on the team.

529
00:44:34,039 --> 00:44:35,440
I don't think
Ryu's that kind of person.

530
00:44:35,539 --> 00:44:37,349
Hey! Do you think you're so tough?

531
00:44:37,409 --> 00:44:38,480
Hey!

532
00:44:38,550 --> 00:44:39,449
Why are you guys fighting?

533
00:44:39,579 --> 00:44:41,980
I always look bad
in everyone's eyes anyway.

534
00:44:42,079 --> 00:44:43,190
I want to pay you back

535
00:44:43,619 --> 00:44:45,650
for jumping in the pool to save me.

536
00:44:45,820 --> 00:44:48,360
Seeing you smile
makes me feel better.

537
00:44:48,719 --> 00:44:50,130
Did you remind Ryu?

538
00:44:50,230 --> 00:44:52,090
You know how much I lost
because of him last time?

539
00:44:52,159 --> 00:44:54,960
I hope you won't
disappoint me tonight.
